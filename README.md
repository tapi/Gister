# Gister #
------

This is a Gist snippet app that manipulates the pasteboard on OSX. Copy the code you want to send to a gist and hit ⌥⌘G and you get a handy little Gist editor window. Once you submit the URL to your gist is sent back to your clipboard so you can easily share it with others.

## Building from source ##

This app uses cocoapods so be sure to do a `pod install` and use the workspace.

## Things to do ##
 - Refactor (since this was a hackday project everythings in the app delegate, blech)
 - Icon
 - Syntax highlighting
 - Customizable hot keys would be cool
